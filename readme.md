# Day 29 Task | Cohort 2.0

This file contains all the **JavaScript exercises and experiments** I completed as part of **Day 29** in **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.  
It covers **core JavaScript concepts** including operators, hoisting, conditional statements, and logical reasoning, tested directly in the browser console.

📌 **About the Day 29 Task**  
Day 29 focused on **practicing and experimenting** with **JavaScript operators**, **variable hoisting**, and **conditional statements**.  
The goal was to strengthen understanding of how JavaScript evaluates expressions, handles variable scope, and performs logical and conditional operations.

✨ **Task Description**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Basic Operators** | Practiced **arithmetic**, **assignment**, **increment/decrement**, **comparison**, **logical**, and **bitwise** operators. |
| **Variable Hoisting** | Explored behavior of **var**, **let**, **const**, and function declarations or expressions. |
| **Conditional Statements** | Used **if**, **else if**, **else**, **ternary**, and **switch** for decision-making logic. |
| **User Interaction** | Implemented **prompt()** to take user input for **age**, **marks**, and other values. |
| **Logical Operators** | Applied **(&&)**, **(OR)**, and **(!)** to create complex conditions and validate multiple checks. |
| **Bitwise Operators** | Introduced **(&)** and **(OR symbol)** for simple bitwise calculations. |

🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **JavaScript** – Core concepts, operators, hoisting, and conditional logic  
- **Browser Console** – Running scripts and checking outputs  
- **HTML** – For embedding scripts and testing interactions  

📖 **Learning Outcome**  
Through this task, I learned how to:  
- Use **arithmetic**, **assignment**, **comparison**, **logical**, and **bitwise operators**  
- Understand **variable hoisting** and differences between **var**, **let**, and **const**  
- Implement **conditional logic** using **if-else**, **ternary**, and **switch statements**  
- Take user input via **prompt()** and provide dynamic console output  
- Apply **logical operators** to evaluate multiple conditions  
- Predict **JavaScript behavior** for expressions, functions, and variable declarations  

🌟 **Acknowledgement**  
This task was completed as part of **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0** under **Harsh Bhaiya**.  

It reinforced **JavaScript fundamentals**, **operator usage**, **hoisting behavior**, and **conditional programming practice**.
